# UniTR: The First Unified Multi-modal Transformer Backbone for 3D Perception

This repo is the official implementation of **ICCV2023** paper: [UniTR: A Unified and Efficient Multi-Modal Transformer for Bird's-Eye-View Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07732) as well as the follow-ups. Our UniTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes Dataset with a real unified and weight-sharing multi-modal (e.g., `Cameras` and `LiDARs`) backbone. UniTR is built upon the codebase of [DSVT](https://github.com/Haiyang-W/DSVT), we have made every effort to ensure that the codebase is clean, concise, easily readable, state-of-the-art, and relies only on minimal dependencies.

üöÄ Gratitude to Tang Hao for extensive code refactoring and noteworthy contributions to open-source initiatives. His invaluable efforts were pivotal in ensuring the seamless completion of UniTR.

üî• üëÄ Honestly, the partition in Unitr is slow and takes about 40% of the total time, but this can be optimized to zero with better strategies or some engineering efforts, indicating that there is still huge room for speed optimization. We're not the HPC experts, but if anyone in the industry wants to improve this, we believe it could be halved. Importantly, this part doesn't scale with model size, making it friendly for larger models.

üìò I am going to share my understanding and future plan of the general 3D perception foundation model without reservation. Please refer to üî• [Potential Research](https://github.com/Haiyang-W/UniTR#potential-research)üî• . If you find it useful for your research or inspiring, feel free to join me in building this blueprint.

## Introduction
Jointly processing information from multiple sensors is crucial to achieving accurate and robust perception for reliable autonomous driving systems. However, current 3D perception research follows a modality-specific paradigm, leading to additional computation overheads and inefficient collaboration between different sensor data. 
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/Figure2.png" width="500"/>
</div>

In this paper, we present an efficient multi-modal backbone for outdoor 3D perception, which processes a variety of modalities with unified modeling and shared parameters. It is a fundamentally task-agnostic backbone that naturally supports different 3D perception tasks. It sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark, achieving `+1.1 NDS` higher for 3D object detection and `+12.0 mIoU` higher for BEV map segmentation with lower inference latency.

### What's new here?
#### üî• Beats previous SOTAs of outdoor multi-modal 3D Object Detection and BEV Segmentation
Our approach has achieved the best performance on multiple tasks (e.g., 3D Object Detection and BEV Map Segmentation), and it is highly versatile, requiring only the replacement of the backbone.
##### 3D Object Detection
<div align="left">
  <img src="assets/Figure4.png" width="700"/>
</div>

##### BEV Map Segmentation
<div align="left">
  <img src="assets/Figure5.png" width="700"/>
</div>

#### üî• Weight-Sharing among all modalities 
We introduce a modality-agnostic transformer encoder to handle these view-discrepant sensor data for parallel modal-wise representation learning and automatic cross-modal interaction without additional fusion steps.

#### üî• Prerequisite for 3D vision foundation models
A weight-shared unified multimodal encoder is a prerequisite for foundation models, especially in the context of 3D perception, unifying information from both images and LiDAR data. This is the first truly multimodal fusion backbone, seamlessly connecting to any 3D detection head.

# NOTE: evaluation results will not be logged in *.log, only be printed in the teminal
```

### Cache Testing 
- üî•If the camera and Lidar parameters of the dataset you are using remain constant, then using our cache mode will not affect performance. You can even cache all mapping calculations during the training phase, which can significantly accelerate your training speed.
- Each sample in Nuscenes will `have some variations in camera parameters`, and during normal inference, we disable the cache mode to ensure result accuracy. However, due to the robustness of our mapping, even in scenarios with camera parameter variations like Nuscenes, the performance will only drop slightly (around 0.4 NDS).
- Cache mode only supports batch_size 1 now, 8x1=8
- Backbone caching will reduce 40% inference latency in our observation.
```shell
# Only for 3D Object Detection

## Potential Research
* **Infrastructure of 3D Vision Foundation Model.**
  An efficient network design is crucial for large models. With a reliable model structure, the development of large models can be advanced. How to make a general multimodal backbone more efficient and easy to deploy. Honestly, the partition in Unitr is slow and takes about 40% of the total time, but this can be optimized to zero with better `partition strategies` or `some engineering efforts`, indicating that there is still huge room for speed optimization. We're not the HPC experts, but if anyone in the industry wants to improve this, we believe it could be halved. Importantly, this part doesn't scale with model size, making it friendly for larger models. 
* **Multi-Modal Self-supervised Learning based on Image-Lidar pair and UniTR.**
  Please refer to the following figure. The images and point clouds both describe the same 3D scene; they complement each other in terms of highly informative correspondence. This allows for the unsupervised learning of more generic scene representation with shared parameters.
* **Single-Modal Pretraining.** Our model is almost the same as ViT (except for some position embedding strategies). If we adjust the position embedding appropriately, DSVT and UniTR can directly load the pretrained parameters of ViT. This is beneficial for better integration with the 2D community.
* **Unifide Modeling of 3D Vision.**
  Please refer to the following figure.

## Possible Issues
* If you encounter a gradient that becomes NaN during fp16 training, not support.
* If you couldn‚Äôt find a solution, search open and closed issues in our github issues page [here](https://github.com/Haiyang-W/UniTR/issues).
* We provide torch checkpoints option [here](https://github.com/Haiyang-W/UniTR/blob/3f75dc1a362fe8f325dabd2e878ac57df2ab7323/tools/cfgs/nuscenes_models/unitr.yaml#L125) in training stage by default for saving CUDA memory 50%.
* Samples in Nuscenes have some variations in camera parameters. So, during training, every sample recalculates the camera-lidar mapping, which significantly slows down the training speed (~40%). If the extrinsic parameters in your dataset are consistent, I recommend caching this computation during training.
* If still no-luck, open a new issue in our github. Our turnaround is usually a couple of days.
